# COVID-19Exposure-ShieldingPregnantWomen
We have developed a method that combines datasets on PCR testing results and serology testing results to infer the temporal trends of exposure and seroprevalence among pregnant women during the COVID-19 epidemic. We fit the mathematical model jointly to serology and PCR categorical time-series data using a Bayesian statistical observation model. By comparing exposure levels in pregnant women to the levels in the general population, we estimated the impact of self-protection on reducing the level of exposure among pregnant women during 2020 who gave birth in this New York City hospital to be approximately 50%. 

All codes and materials used in the analyses are included in this repository. All parameter estimates and figures presented can be reproduced using the code provided. The original datasets from pregnant women can be made available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.
